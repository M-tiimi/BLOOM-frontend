## Project idea
This project was created during Haaga-Helia's Software Poject II -course. in fall 2021.
In this project, the idea is to create an app ment for aiding user in taking care of their physical and mental health. This is done with few different functionalities. 
### Flower
The main idea is to take care of a flower which will grow when user is taking care of themselfes, and starts to die when not. There are ready-made tasks, for example
brushing your teeth, or eating a proper meal, which when done, gives user points which grow the flower. The user can add their own tasks too.
### Bot
The app will ask you daily how are you doing, and prompt you to give answer. You can tell the bot things, and it will follow on how are you doing based on what you write.
### Information
There is also an information page for the user to find more resources on how to keep your mind and body happy and healthy.
## Getting Started
First you must create a user to be able to login.
